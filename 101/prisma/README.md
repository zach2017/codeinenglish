 # Prisma schema for your task management database. 

## **Core Tables:**

### **Person Table**
- Basic info: email, name, optional role
- Relationships to tasks (both created and assigned)
- Timestamps for tracking when users were added/updated

### **Task Table** 
- **Basic fields**: title, description, status, priority
- **Time tracking**: startTime, endTime, dueDate for scheduling
- **Relationships**:
  - `assignee`: Person assigned to the task
  - `creator`: Person who created the task
  - `parent/children`: Self-referential for task hierarchy (subtasks)
  - `dependsOn/dependedBy`: Many-to-many for task dependencies
- **Status tracking**: Using an enum with states like TODO, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED
- **Priority levels**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT

## **Additional Features:**

### **Comment Table**
Allows discussion threads on tasks
x
### **Tag Table** 
For categorizing and filtering tasks

## **Key Design Decisions:**

1. **PostgreSQL as default** - You can change this to MySQL, SQLite, or SQL Server
2. **CUID for IDs** - Provides globally unique identifiers
3. **Soft relations** - Using `onDelete: SetNull` for assignees so tasks remain if a person is deleted
4. **Cascade deletes** - Child tasks and comments are deleted with their parent
5. **Indexes** - Added on frequently queried fields for performance

To use this schema:
1. Save it as `schema.prisma` in your project's `prisma` folder
2. Set your DATABASE_URL in `.env`
3. Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to create the database tables
4. Run `npx prisma generate` to create the Prisma Client

The schema supports common task management scenarios like task hierarchies, dependencies between tasks, time tracking, and status management while keeping the structure simple and extensible.
